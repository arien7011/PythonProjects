#Tuples is a data structure to store elements it is immutable in nature that means the values in the tuple cannot be changed

#define a tuple

numbers = (12,24,34,45,32)
print(numbers)
newnumber = () #empty tuples
print(newnumber)

# newtuple = (1) #this is a wrong way to define a tuple it is like you storing a number in a variable

newtuple = (1,) #add a commma while creating a tuple with a single item
print(newtuple)
